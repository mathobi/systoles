def max_systole_h11( n, lower_bound=0, n_threads=2 ):
    r"""
    This function computes the maximal length of a shortest systole on Origamis
    in the stratum H(1,1) with exactly `n` squares.

    INPUT:

    - ``n`` -- a positive integer. The number of squares of the Origamis in
      H(1,1) to consider.

    - ``lower_bound`` -- a positive real number (default: `0`). A known lower
      bound for the maximal length of a shortest systole on Origamis in H(1,1)
      with `n` squares. If the algorithm encounters an Origami with a systole
      of smaller length than `lower_bound`, it discards the Origami immediately
      without determining the exact systolic ratio.

    - ``n_threads`` -- a positive integer (default: `2`). The number of threads
      that should be used for the computation. The algorithm decomposes the set
      of Origamis with `n` squares into a disjoint union of orbits under the
      action of SL(2,ZZ) on Origamis and deals with each orbit in a separate
      thread.


    OUTPUT: A tuple `(o,m)` consisting of the maximal length `m` of a shortest
    systole and an Origami `o` that achieves this bound.
